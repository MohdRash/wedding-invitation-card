# Islamic Wedding Invitation

This project appears to be a digital Islamic wedding invitation, likely a static website, based on the file structure and names like `index.html` and audio files.

## Features

- Digital wedding invitation format
- Includes audio elements (`fulfilling-humming.mp3`, `nature-sound.mp3`)
- Visual elements like images
- Custom fonts (`GreatVibes-Regular.ttf`, `exmouth_.ttf`)
- Optimized for web preview (`preview.png`, `og-image.jpg`)

## Installation

Since this appears to be a static website, no complex installation is required. You can simply host the contents of the `dist` directory on any web server.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Upload the entire `dist` folder content to your web hosting service.
3. Ensure `index.html` is accessible as the main entry point.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or access it via the hosted URL to view the wedding invitation.

## Credits

- Fonts: `GreatVibes-Regular.ttf`, `exmouth_.ttf`
- Audio: `fulfilling-humming.mp3`, `nature-sound.mp3`


Feel free to customize the content of `index.html` and replace assets in the `audio`, `font`, and `images` directories to personalize your invitation.
